                     <p><ul class="default">
<ul>  <li>This course is an advanced study of important modern topics in the <em>principles</em> of programming languages.  It builds on the material of 601.426/626, Principles of Programming Languages.</li>
  <li> Topics covered include operational semantics, type systems, program analysis, and program verification.  See the <a href="syllabus.shtml">sylllabus</a> for more details.
  <li>Programming in the course will be in OCaml, we will assume students are familiar with OCaml or can pick it up on their own.</li>
  <li>It will meet for three days a week for an hour. The MW meetings will be lecture and the F meeting will be paper readings and will share a time slot with the PL reading group.</li>
  <li>This course is recommended for students that already have background in programming language principles, e.g. by taking 601.426/626.  If you have the background but did not take 601.426/626, email the professor to obtain permission to add.</li>
